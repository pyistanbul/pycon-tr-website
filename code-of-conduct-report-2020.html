  <h3>What is this document and what purpose does it serve?</h3>
		<p>
      This document is created by the Code of Conduct team of PyCon Turkey for transparency of the processes that are applicable, and the events that occur throughout the PyCon Turkey 2020 event, in the context of code of conduct.
		</p>
		<p>
      Name of the members of the committee, by which rationale and guidelines the processes were carried out, and what was done is part of this document, and of course, the names in incidents are not shared because of privacy concerns.
		</p>
    <h3>How was the Code of Conduct set up and presented?</h3>
    <p>
      The event gathered around 1016 (1802 registered) participants and the Code of Conduct team was formed by five members taking diversity into consideration. The Code of Conduct was available online via the conference‚Äôs <a href="https://tr.pycon.org/code-of-conduct.html">website</a> (link on the navigation bar, accessible through any page).
    </p>
    <p>
    The team held a meeting before the event and we decided on the following points:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any incident brought to the attention of one of the PyCon Turkey Team members will be discussed by the entirety of the Code of Conduct team.</li>
        <li>A private Discord channel will be used for communicating among the Code of Conduct team.</li>
        <li>PyCon Turkey organizers will reach the Code of Conduct team through a private Discord channel.</li>
        <li>Attendees can reach Code of Conduct team or team members individually by emails written on the Code of Conduct page.</li>
        <li>A report will be written and published by the end of the conference, without naming anybody. </li>
        <li>Example warning messages for incidents were prepared before the event.</li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
    <h3>Incidents</h3>
    <h4>Incident 2020-01: Non-English Messages</h4>
    <p>The PyCon Turkey organization team decided to organize the event in English.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the communication during the event should be in English. However, There were some non-English messages. We kindly asked to speak English in the chat. The message we used was ‚ÄúPlease keep conversations in the chat stream in English since it is an international conference, so that everybody can understand.‚Äù. This type of incident has occurred a few times. We deleted non-English chat messages during the event. </p>
    <h4>Incident 2020-02: A Humiliating Message</h4>
    <p>During the session talk, one of the participants sent a humiliating message about someone in the session chat. We discussed this as the Code of Conduct Team. Then, we decided to delete this message. After the deletion, "As per our code of conduct, please be kind to each other - PyCon Turkey Team" message was sent to the channel.</p>
    <h3>Retrospective</h3>
    <h4>Things that went fine</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>    We checked all of the chat messages and email inboxes. Also, we followed Discord channels for internal communication. The actions were taken swiftly when necessary.</li>
        <li>The individual emails of the Code of Conduct Team Members were shared in the Code of Conduct page so that the participants and the speakers could communicate with the Code of Conduct team members in the case of a conflict of interest.</li>
        <li>The Code of Conduct team took feedback constantly from the PyCon Turkey Team throughout the event.</li>
        <li>We know that gender diversity fosters creativity and innovation. Therefore, we attached importance to keep women rate high in the Code of Conduct Team. Our objective in the conferences that we will hold from now on will be to even increase this rate by showing the same sensitivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Things to improve</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Since there were also some other responsibilities of the Code of Conduct Team Members in the conferences, the responsibility was placed on one or two people at certain times. Henceforward, we are planning not to give several responsibilities to the team members of Code of Conduct in the following events.</li>
    </ul>
